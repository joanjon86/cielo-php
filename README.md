# Installation

In the DB folder of the repo there is the file dump cielo_php-2019-09-26.sql to re-create my database.

Remember to verify the name of the database and the mysql user and password in the codeigniter configuration file so that the db connection can be established correctly.

In the database there are already some data as examples.
